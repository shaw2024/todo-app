This project is a modern, responsive React Todo App that helps users manage daily tasks and communicate through a contact form. It includes two main views: todos, for creating and managing a task list, and contact, for submitting user information and messages.The app features a clean design, a mobile-friendly layout with a hamburger menu, and clear task organization with filters.

How to Use It
Visit the Todo page
Add a new task using the input field
Click on a task to mark it as complete (strikethrough appears)
Delete a task with the remove button
Filter tasks by All, Completed, or Incomplete
Visit the Contact page
Fill in your first name, last name, email, and a comment
All fields are controlled, meaning the app updates the state as you type

Navigate
Use the top navbar to switch between views
