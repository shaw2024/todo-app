This project is a modern, responsive React Todo App that helps users manage daily tasks and communicate through a contact form. It includes two main views: todos, for creating and managing a task list, and contact, for submitting user information and messages.The app features a clean design, a mobile-friendly layout with a hamburger menu, and clear task organization with filters.

How to Use It
Visit the Todo page
Add a new task using the input field
Click on a task to mark it as complete (strikethrough appears)
Delete a task with the remove button
Filter tasks by All, Completed, or Incomplete
Visit the Contact page
Fill in your first name, last name, email, and a comment
All fields are controlled, meaning the app updates the state as you type

Navigate
Use the top navbar to switch between views
On smaller screens, use the hamburger menu

Technologies Used
React.js – Framework for building the app interface
HTML – Structure of the rendered components
CSS – Custom styling (10+ rules for layout, spacing, colors, and responsiveness)
JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic for state, events, and interactivity
React Router DOM – Routing between /todos and /contact

Future Improvements
Persist Data
Store todos in localStorage or a database so they stay after refreshing the page
Form Validation & Confirmation
Add validation and a confirmation message after submitting the contact form
Dark Mode Toggle
Provide a toggle to switch between light and dark themes
Drag-and-Drop Reordering
Let users reorder tasks visually
